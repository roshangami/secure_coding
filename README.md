# Secure coding for Web application development

This repository shows how to develop the basic web application feature. Finding vulnerability in that feature, attacking that vulnerability and lastly mitigating the vulnerability.

## Develop -> Attack -> Mitigate

## SQL Injection 

* SQL injection is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities in which the user supplied data is being directly passed to SQL Query without any  validation. It enables attackers to execute arbitrary SQL Queries.
* Allows attackers to bypass Login
* Successful exploitation allows attackers to compromise the entire Database.
